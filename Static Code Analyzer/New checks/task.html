<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>Let's add new checks that will make our code better arranged and more clear. All these checks are consistent with the PEP8 style guide.</p>

<h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>

<p>In this stage, you need to add five new checks in your program:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>[S002] Indentation is not a multiple of four</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>[S003] Unnecessary semicolon after a statement (note, semicolons are admissible in comments)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>[S004] At least two spaces before inline comments required</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>[S005] TODO found (only in comments; the case does not matter)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>[S006] More than two blank lines used before this line (must be output for the first non-empty line)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>If a line contains the same stylistic issue several times, your program must print the information only once. But if a single line has different issues with different codes, they should be printed in the sorted order.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To simplify the solution, we consider it acceptable if your program finds some false-positive stylistic issues in strings, especially multi-lines (<code class="language-python">'''...'''</code> and <code class="language-python">"""..."""</code>).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>We recommend you to break the code into a set of functions to avoid confusion.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>As before:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The path to a file with Python code is obtained from the standard input.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The general output format is:</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-python">Line X: Code Message</code></pre>

<ul>
	<li>The order of lines with their issues must always be first to last.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here is an example of a Python file (please never write code like this):</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print('What\'s your name?') # reading an input
name = input();
print(f'Hello, {name}');  # here is an obvious comment: this prints greeting with a name


very_big_number = 11_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000
print(very_big_number)


def some_fun():
    print('NO TODO HERE;;')
    pass; # Todo something
</code></pre>

<p>It contains 9 code style issues:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Line 1: S004 At least two spaces before inline comment required
Line 2: S003 Unnecessary semicolon
Line 3: S001 Too long
Line 3: S003 Unnecessary semicolon
Line 6: S001 Too long
Line 11: S006 More than two blank lines used before this line
Line 13: S003 Unnecessary semicolon
Line 13: S004 At least two spaces before inline comment required
Line 13: S005 TODO found
</code></pre>
