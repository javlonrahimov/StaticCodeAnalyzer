<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>One way to write beautiful and consistently formatted code with Python is following the PEP8 specification and practices recommended by the Python community. This is not always easy, especially for beginners. Luckily, there are special tools called <strong>static code analyzers</strong> (pylint, flake8, and others) that can automatically verify that your code meets all the standards and recommendations. The tools analyze your code and output all the issues they find. They don't execute your code, they only read it.</p>

<p>In this project, you will create a small static analyzer tool that finds some common stylistic mistakes in Python code. This way, you will get the general idea of static code analysis and improve your Python skills.</p>

<p>PEP8 says that we should "limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters". For example, it keeps your code more readable. So, at the first iteration, we'll make a program that checks that lines in code are not too long.</p>

<h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>

<p>In this stage, your program must read Python code from a specified file and perform only a single check: lines in the code must not be longer than 79 characters.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The path to the file is obtained from the standard input.</li>
	<li>The general output format is:
	<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Line X: Code Message
</code></pre>

	<p>In the format:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><strong>X</strong> is the number of the line where the issue was found. The count starts with one.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Code</strong> is the code of the particular stylistic issue (like S001).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Message </strong>is a human-readable description of the issue (optional).</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For example:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Line 3: S001 Too long</code></pre>

	<p>This format will be used throughout the project with some minor changes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>The order of the lines must always be first to last.</li>
	<li>Your program can output another message instead of <code class="language-python">Too long</code>. The rest of the output must exactly match the provided example. In this code <code class="language-python">S001</code>, <code class="language-python">S</code> means a stylistic issue, and <code class="language-python">001</code> is the internal number of the issue.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here is an example of the file's content:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print('What\'s your name?')
name = input()
print(f'Hello, {name}')  # here is an obvious comment: this prints greeting with a name

very_big_number = 11_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000
print(very_big_number)
</code></pre>

<p>This code contains two long lines (&gt;79 characters): lines 3 and 5.</p>

<p>Here is the expected output for the given example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Line 3: S001 Too long
Line 5: S001 Too long
</code></pre>
